mShell
======

This is a simple shell originally written for a class project.  It has since been cleaned up some and is a nice pet project I work on when I get bored with other projects.

!!! WARNING !!!
If you are a student looking for code to use in your own implementation of a shell, be advised that this code exists in at least one, probably more, MOSS databases and use of this code without attribution is not only a bad idea, but may be in breach of your institutions policies on academic honesty.
